    <string name="about_text">CHRONI is a mobile application developed by the <b>Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences</b>, CIRDLES, at the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC. CIRDLES is creating cyber infrastructure for geochronology in an interdisciplinary collaboration among our software engineers and geochemists from two NSF-supported initiatives, EARTHTIME and EarthChem. Using <b>ET Redux</b>, users can upload and retrieve their data and results to the GeoChron.org data repository. If you are interested in learning more about CIRDLES, please contact Dr. Bowring at <i>bowringj@cofc.edu.</i>\n
Currently, Gabrielle Cozart and Tyler Newman, sophmores at the College of Charleston have been working with Dr. James Bowring to develop this application. Gabrielle has been working on CHRONI since January 2015. If you are interested in contacting her for inquiries about the application, please email her at <i>cozartge@g.cofc.edu.</i> \n
We would like to thank the College of Charleston Department of Computer Science, for providing financial support for CIRDLES. Funding was also provided by grant EAR-0930223 from the National Science Foundation and College of Charlestonâ€™s Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities MAYS Program.</string>
