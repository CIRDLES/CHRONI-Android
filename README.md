CHRONI

**CHRONI** is a mobile application that presents archived data downloaded from the Geochron database in a customizable format for use by geologists in the field. Currently, the **CHRONI** application only works with Android devices. The project is led and maintained by [CIRDLES](https://cirdles.org), an undergraduate research lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina.
